Whose fox is that? 
I think I know. 
Its owner is quite happy though. 
Full of joy like a vivid rainbow, 
I watch her laugh. 
I cry hello.

She gives her fox a shake, 
And laughs until her belly aches. 
The only other sound's the break, 
Of distant waves and birds awake.

The fox is curious, orange and deep, 
But she has promises to keep, 
After cake and lots of sleep. 
Sweet dreams come to her.
